# Firefly Synchronization

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/kadikraman/CarExpensesAPI/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/kadikraman/CarExpensesAPI)

Firefly synchronization simulation with d3.js

## Setting up
- run 'bower install' in the root directory
- open any static file server in the root directory (e.g. node's http-server)


## Plans for the future
- smother colours for the firefly 'blink'
- option for fireflies to move randomly instead of staying static
- graph examples for the synchronization algorithm
- settings panel should 'look better'
